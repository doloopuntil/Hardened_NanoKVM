# NanoKVM Native Runtime Assets

This directory contains the native NanoKVM runtime pieces used by the Rust
backend.

- `dl_lib/` is packaged to the device as `/kvmapp/server/dl_lib`.
- `include/` contains the C ABI header used by the Rust FFI bindings.

The corresponding native sources are under `support/sg2002/additional/kvm`,
`kvm_mmf`, `vision`, and `peripheral`. The Rust FFI mutex serializes calls made
by Rust, but native capture/detection threads still have their own lifecycle.
Known native lifecycle, VENC, bounds, and hardware-error findings are tracked in
[`docs/native-code-audit.md`](../../docs/native-code-audit.md).

The Rust server is the only supported backend for these runtime assets.

## libkvm.so: removed video NEEDED entry

`dl_lib/libkvm.so` originally declared `DT_NEEDED` on
`libopencv_video.so.409`, which in this build's OpenCV pulls in a chain
(`video`→`dnn`+`calib3d`; `calib3d`→`features2d`+`flann`; `dnn`→`protobuf`)
of 6 additional non-redistributable vendor libraries. Verified via
`readelf --dyn-syms` that `libkvm.so` calls nothing from any of them: its
184 undefined function symbols were checked against video's exports
directly (zero overlap) and against the full export set unique to
video/dnn/calib3d/features2d/flann as a group, not also provided by
core/imgproc/imgcodecs/highgui (still zero overlap, 978 candidate symbols
checked). This points to the dependency being a MaixCDK build-convention
artifact (linking a common library set), not a real call path.

Patched with `patchelf --remove-needed libopencv_video.so.409 dl_lib/libkvm.so`.
This only edits the ELF dynamic section (verified: file size and the full
184-symbol undefined-symbol set are unchanged) -- no code is modified.
`libkvm.so` now needs only `core`/`highgui`/`imgcodecs`/`imgproc` from
OpenCV, matching the exact 4 modules `sipeed/NanoKVM` (the GPL-3.0
upstream) ships in its own `server/dl_lib/`, rather than the 9 this fork's
vendor-runtime staging previously carried. `libkvm_mmf.so` never needed
any OpenCV module.

Not yet verified on real hardware -- this is static analysis (symbol-table
comparison), not a device boot/video test. If HDMI capture or any vision
feature breaks after this change, this is the first thing to revert.

## libkvm_mmf.so statically embeds its own copy of the LT6911 driver

The LT6911 sensor-id-probe-retry patch applied to `vendor-sdk-stock`'s
checkout of `sipeed/LicheeRV-Nano-Build` (see
`buildroot-external/hardened-sg2002/board/sg2002/vendor-sdk-patches/`)
never reached the code actually driving HDMI capture. `libkvm_mmf.so` is
built by MaixCDK (`support/sg2002/additional/kvm_mmf/CMakeLists.txt`)
against a *second*, independent copy of the same upstream sensor source --
`sipeed/MaixCDK`'s own `components/3rd_party/sophgo-middleware/` checkout
-- compiled directly into `libkvm_mmf.so` as source, not linked against
`/mnt/system/usr/lib/libsns_lt6911.so` (confirmed: `libkvm_mmf.so`'s
`NEEDED` entries don't include it, and the compiled-in `__FILE__` string
in `libkvm_mmf.so` points at `.../MaixCDK/components/3rd_party/...`, not
the vendor-sdk-stock path). Diffed MaixCDK's copy of `lt6911_sensor_ctl.c`
against vendor-sdk-stock's: byte-for-byte identical, same dead code, same
unpatched probe timing. `/mnt/system/usr/lib/libsns_lt6911.so` is real and
correctly patched, but nothing in the running process tree (`kvm_system`,
`libkvm.so`, `libkvm_mmf.so`) loads it.

`.github/workflows/build-sg2002-image.yml`'s `build-native-libkvm` job now
rebuilds `libkvm.so`/`libkvm_mmf.so` from source via MaixCDK instead of
reusing the prebuilt app 2.0.42 archive copies, applying the same LT6911
retry patch to MaixCDK's checkout before building. It starts from
`woffko/Hardened_NanoKVM`'s own current `support/sg2002/additional/`
source tree (`HARDENED_NANOKVM_NATIVE_SRC_COMMIT`, their "Harden native
video path for app 2.0.34 RC10" commit, 2026-07-11) rather than this
fork's older copy of those files -- their rebuild fixed unrelated
lifecycle/audit findings and a separate sensor-name-table `SAMPLE_SNS_TYPE_E`
mismatch, but left this exact dead code in place too (checked: their
currently-published `libkvm_mmf.so` still contains the same unpatched
`read sensor id error.`/`Sensor ID Mismatch!` strings). Not yet verified
on real hardware -- this is the first build where the LT6911 retry patch
will actually execute.

## /mnt/system/usr: pruned to the one file dl_lib doesn't cover

`/mnt/system/usr/bin` (CVITEK sample/test binaries: `sample_vcodec`,
`sample_venc`, `sample_vdec`, `ive_stress`, `sensor_test`, `test_mmf`, etc.)
and most of `/mnt/system/usr/lib` (the same CVI/ISP/audio libraries already
present in `dl_lib`, plus `libov_ov2685.so`, `libraw_replay.so`,
`libsample.so`, and 5 `libsns_*.so` sensor plugins for sensors this
hardware doesn't have -- only the LT6911 HDMI bridge is real here) look
like unpruned vendor SDK carry-forward, not load-bearing content.

Provenance: same as the loaders and `auto.sh` above -- extracted wholesale
via `debugfs rdump /mnt/system` from `make vendor-sdk-stock`'s own build
output in `scripts/prepare-latest-buildroot-sg2002-vendor-runtime.sh`,
frozen into the vendor-runtime staging bundle, carried forward unchanged
since.

`/etc/init.d/S95nanokvm` does wire `/mnt/system/usr/lib` and
`/mnt/system/usr/lib/3rd` into the native library search path
(`NANOKVM_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH`, passed to the musl loader's
`--library-path` when launching the server, `kvm_system`, and
`nanokvm-hwmon`) -- so it's not simply unreferenced, it's a deliberate
fallback. But `/kvmapp/server/dl_lib` is checked first in that same path
and already contains every file `/mnt/system/usr/lib` and its `3rd/`
subdirectory (`libcli.so`, `libini.so`) have, except exactly the
suspect files above -- so the fallback never actually gets exercised for
anything these binaries need.

Compared the 22 overlapping libraries byte-for-byte on the same rootfs:
16 are identical between `dl_lib` and `/mnt/system/usr/lib`, but 6
(`libcvi_bin.so`, `libsys.so`, `libvdec.so`, `libvpu.so`, `libmisc.so`,
`libosdc.so`) are the same name and size but substantively different
content -- e.g. `libsys.so` differs in 38,510 of 60,472 bytes, far
beyond a timestamp/build-id difference. So `/mnt/system/usr/lib` isn't
simply "the same files copied twice"; it looks like a separate, older
snapshot of the vendor SDK's own libraries that happens to share
names/sizes with what got curated into `dl_lib`. Doesn't change the
functional conclusion (`dl_lib` still wins the search-path race
regardless of which build variant sits in the fallback), but it's a
more accurate description than "duplicate."

Checked for a `dlopen()`-style indirect reference (the one thing static
`strings`/symbol analysis can miss) in `libkvm.so`, `libkvm_mmf.so`,
`kvm_system`, and `nanokvm-hwmon`, plus every script under `/etc` and
`/kvmapp/system` and this repo's own tracked source
(`server-rust`, `web`, `support/sg2002`, `scripts`): zero genuine hits.
The one grep match (`support/sg2002/additional/sophgo-middleware/v2/sample/common/sample_common_sensor.c`)
is a false positive -- a self-referential filename comment and header
include, unrelated to the `/mnt/system/usr/bin` executables.

**Acted on, narrower than "drop it entirely."** Checking `dl_lib`'s actual
file listing against `/mnt/system/usr/lib`'s turned up one exception to
the above: `libsns_lt6911.so`, the sensor plugin for the LT6911 HDMI
bridge -- this device's one real sensor -- has no copy anywhere in
`dl_lib`, unlike every other file in `/mnt/system/usr/lib`. Deleting it
along with the rest would have risked the one thing this device actually
does (HDMI capture), for no size benefit worth that risk.

`hardened-sg2002-vendor-runtime.mk` now removes `/mnt/system/usr/bin`
entirely and prunes `/mnt/system/usr/lib` (including the `3rd/`
subdirectory) down to exactly `libsns_lt6911.so`. Everything *removed* is
either proven redundant (shadowed by `dl_lib` in the library search order)
or has no reference anywhere in this repo's tracked source. The retained
file's own provenance is now fully resolved too -- see "libc.so, GCC
runtime, loaders, and libsns_lt6911.so" below; it no longer comes from
raw.12 either. Not yet verified on real hardware; if HDMI capture breaks
after this change, this is still the first thing to check.

## dl_lib's CVI/ISP/audio middleware: no longer extracted from raw.12

The ~32 CVI/ISP/audio middleware libraries checked into this directory
(`libcvi_*`, `libisp*`, `libae`/`libaf`/`libawb`, `libaac*`, `libcli.so`,
`libini.so`, `libmisc.so`, `libosdc.so`, `libsys.so`, `libtinyalsa.so`,
`libvdec.so`/`libvenc.so`/`libvpu.so`, etc.) have been in git since the
`RC5` commit, long before this fork started sourcing a build from the
published raw.12 image. Diffed byte-for-byte against raw.12's own
`/kvmapp/server/dl_lib`: every one of them is identical. The CI pipeline
used to extract them wholesale from raw.12 anyway (redundant but
harmless, since the bytes matched) via
`hardened-sg2002-vendor-runtime.mk`'s `cp -a kvmapp-dl-lib/.` overlay,
which ran *after* `hardened-nanokvm-kvmapp.mk` had already installed
this directory's own content.

`build-sg2002-image.yml`'s "Extract vendor runtime staging bundle" step
no longer dumps `/kvmapp/server/dl_lib` wholesale -- the 5 files this
directory doesn't carry (`libc.so` and the 4 GCC runtime libs) no longer
come from raw.12 at all; see below. Final image content is unchanged
(proven byte-identical either way); raw.12 is just no longer asked for
content this repo already has verified in git.

## libc.so, GCC runtime, loaders, and libsns_lt6911.so: closed -- from our own build

Tried sourcing `libc.so` and the GCC runtime libs (`libstdc++.so.6.0.28`,
`libgcc_s.so.1`, `libgomp.so.1.0.0`, `libatomic.so.1.2.0`) from the public
`sophgo/host-tools` cross-toolchain repo instead of raw.12, the same way
the two T-Head loaders were tried there and rejected. Same dead end for
`libc.so`: that repo ships 4 ABI variant sysroots, and every one of the 6
candidate `libc.so` files across all of them is ~7-8x the size of raw.12's
copy (4.2-5.4 MB vs. 621 KB) -- a systematic mismatch, a generic
cross-toolchain build meant for linking against, not the vendor's
on-device runtime build. The GCC runtime libs were closer (matching
version numbers, and the `lib64v0p7_xthead` variant's RISC-V arch
attribute string is an exact match for `libkvm.so`'s own) but still
larger than raw.12's copies, apparently just carrying debug sections a
release strip would remove -- promising, but unconfirmed from that repo.

The actual answer was `make vendor-sdk-stock` (the `sg2002_licheervnano_sd`
defconfig, already built and cached by the `vendor-sdk` CI job) -- the
same real on-device build `prepare-latest-buildroot-sg2002-vendor-runtime.sh`
originally sourced this content from, not a generic toolchain package.
Checked all 8 remaining raw.12-only files against it on a real run: **7 are
byte-identical** -- `libc.so`, all 4 GCC runtime libs, and both T-Head
loaders (`ld-musl-riscv64xthead.so.1`, `ld-musl-riscv64v0p7_xthead.so.1`).
`build-sg2002-image.yml` now sources all 7 from vendor-sdk-stock's own
`rootfs.sd` instead of raw.12, hard-failing if any isn't found (unlike the
diagnostic that discovered these paths, this is production extraction).

`libsns_lt6911.so` was the 8th file checked, and its bytes differ (2,100 of
14,568) -- but tracing exactly *why* closed it too. The source is real,
checked-in C code at
`middleware/v2/component/isp/sensor/cv182x/lontium_lt6911/` in the pinned
`sipeed/LicheeRV-Nano-Build` commit (`sg200x` is a symlink to `cv182x`, so
this is the exact catalog this hardware uses) -- an earlier full-tree
search missed it because GitHub's tree API silently truncates large repos,
the same failure mode later caught and fixed for the `sophgo/host-tools`
`libc.so` search. It isn't in `build/sensors/sensor_list.json` because
that's a curated picker list for user-selectable board sensors, not the
full middleware catalog LT6911 is part of regardless (same as every other
`libsns_*.so`).

`make vendor-sdk-stock` already compiles this source as part of its normal
build (that's how the diagnostic found a `libsns_lt6911.so` there to
compare against in the first place). Diffing exactly where the two builds'
bytes diverge: 91% of the difference sits in `.rodata`, but every string
in it is character-for-character identical except one -- the compiler's
`__FILE__`-embedded absolute source path. raw.12's copy has
`/home/w0w/Hardened_NanoKVM/build/vendor/...`; `w0w` is the maintainer's
own local username, matching the hardcoded path already found in
`docs/build-notes.md` (`NanoKVM_PATH=/home/w0w/...`) and the old default
toolchain path in `scripts/prepare-kernel-5.10.265-vendor-runtime.sh` --
raw.12 was built on the maintainer's own machine, not any CI. This
pipeline's build has `/home/runner/work/Hardened_NanoKVM/...` instead, the
standard GitHub Actions runner path. The differing path length cascades:
every later string in the section shifts by the delta, so a byte-offset
`cmp` reports "91% different" for what is, in content, one string. The
small `.text` diff (86 of 3,184 bytes) is the same shift rippling into
immediate offsets that reference those strings' addresses. Same source,
same compiled logic and data, different build-path debug string that's
never dereferenced as a real path at runtime.

That was true when this file was first traced. It no longer is, deliberately:
`lt6911_probe()`'s chip-ID read ran ~50us after PinMux -- far too soon for
the chip to have completed its own boot sequence -- and logged a
scary-looking (if already non-fatal; both its own failure paths were
already dead code) error on every cold boot with a live HDMI source
connected. `buildroot-external/hardened-sg2002/board/sg2002/vendor-sdk-patches/lt6911-sensor-id-probe-retry.patch`
retries the ID probe for ~100ms before concluding the chip genuinely isn't
there, applied to the vendor SDK checkout before `make vendor-sdk-stock`
builds it. `vendor-sdk-stock`'s `libsns_lt6911.so` is therefore no longer
byte-identical to a truly unmodified vendor build -- deliberately, and only
for this one file; every other file `vendor-sdk-stock` produces is
untouched.

`build-sg2002-image.yml` now sources all 8 files from `vendor-sdk-stock`'s
own `rootfs.sd`. No file shipped in the final image comes from raw.12.

## The module-tree structure: also closed, needed no image at all

The last raw.12 fetch in the pipeline was purely structural: the
`/mnt/system/ko` tree's basenames and `3rd/` nesting (8 of 57 modules nest
there), used only to know where each freshly-rebuilt kernel module belongs
-- module *content* was never sourced from raw.12 once the kernel-module
rebuild work closed that gap. Turns out this didn't need any image at all:
`support/sg2002/kernel/5.10.265/manifests/external-modules.txt` already
encodes the full destination path for all 30 external modules (`3rd/`
prefixes included), `in-tree-modules.txt` gives the other 24 (all flat),
and the 3 media module names are already known constants -- the complete
57-module structure, entirely from files already tracked in this repo.
`rebuild-vendor-external-modules-5.10-baseline.sh`'s own build output was
already placing artifacts at these exact relative paths; nothing needed
extracting them from somewhere else in the first place.

`build-sg2002-image.yml` now builds this structure as an empty-file
skeleton straight from the manifests, no network fetch involved.
`hardened-source-media-provenance.txt` (a plain-text record: source
commits, a device-acceptance marker, a redistribution note) is
regenerated the same way, from values already pinned in the workflow,
rather than copied forward.

raw.12's `/mnt/system` also carried `auto.sh`, `sdk-release`, and (in
older releases) `root/`. Checked and confirmed dead the same way `usr/bin`
and most of `usr/lib` were: `auto.sh` is generic, unused vendor
evaluation-board boilerplate (sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`PATH` for a boot
flow nothing in this repo invokes) with zero references anywhere in
tracked source; `sdk-release` is a static, unread version string;
`root/` doesn't exist in raw.12 at all any more. None are reproduced.

One narrower, genuine content dependency came up while closing this:
`build-historical-sophgo-vc-driver.sh` used to diff `soph_vc_driver.ko`'s
module parameters (`modinfo -F parm`) against an "old" reference copy
pulled from raw.12 -- a real diagnostic, not a structural lookup, since
`modinfo` needs an actual valid compiled module. That comparison has been
removed rather than kept as a narrower exception, so this diagnostic no
longer runs.

**raw.12 is no longer fetched anywhere in this pipeline.**
