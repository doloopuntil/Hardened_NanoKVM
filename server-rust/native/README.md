# NanoKVM Native Runtime Assets

This directory contains the native NanoKVM runtime pieces used by the Rust
backend.

- `dl_lib/` is packaged to the device as `/kvmapp/server/dl_lib`.
- `include/` contains the C ABI header used by the Rust FFI bindings.

The legacy Go backend source tree has been removed from this repository.
