# CI image build

## Run it

```sh
gh workflow run system-image.yml --ref <branch>
```

The run takes several hours. When it finishes, the `sg2002-recovery-sd-image`
artifact (kept 14 days) holds `recovery/` with `hardened-sg2002-port.img` and
`hardened-sg2002-port.img.xz`, and `_reports/` with `SHA256SUMS` and a summary.
Flash the `.img.xz` as described in [Install](../guide/install.md).

Three places must carry the same version or the build fails: `kvmapp/version`,
`HARDENED_NANOKVM_KVMAPP_VERSION` in
`buildroot-external/hardened-sg2002/package/hardened-nanokvm-kvmapp/hardened-nanokvm-kvmapp.mk`,
and `EXPECTED_SYSTEM_VERSION` / `EXPECTED_KVMAPP_VERSION` in the workflow.

## What it builds

`.github/workflows/system-image.yml` rebuilds the SG2002 recovery-SD
image from scratch on `ubuntu-latest`: the vendor SDK, a from-scratch
Buildroot toolchain, the hardened Linux 5.10.265 kernel and every kernel
module, the `kvmapp` application bridge, and the final rootfs/boot/recovery
images. `workflow_dispatch` only -- it is multi-hour and disk-heavy, not run
on every push.

## Why this exists

The originally published `hardened-system-0.3.0-raw.12` release (and the
system-image releases before it) were built locally by the maintainer and
never had a CI job behind them -- `woffko/Hardened_NanoKVM` ships the build
scripts but no workflow invokes them (confirmed: its only workflow is an
unrelated issue-tracker webhook). Fixing the two missing CLI tools
(`nano`, `wg`) that started this work could have meant just patching the
published image. Instead, the goal became rebuilding the whole system from
source in CI so a result can be checked, not just claimed -- if this project
ever proposes an upstream PR, a maintainer should be able to see the
rebuild run clean rather than trust it blindly.

That goal only has teeth if the CI rebuild doesn't quietly lean on the
thing it's supposed to replace. This document tracks how much of the
pipeline still depends on the published raw.12 archive, and what closed
each dependency.

## Pipeline shape

Six jobs. Jobs hand each other files as workflow artifacts (tarred, since
artifacts drop permissions and symlinks), so "re-run failed jobs" reuses
everything that already succeeded.

- **`vendor-sdk-source`** -- the pinned `sipeed/LicheeRV-Nano-Build` SDK and
  `sophgo/host-tools` checkouts (`make vendor-sdk`) plus the tracked
  middleware patch. Takes minutes. The kernel and module jobs need nothing
  the stock build produces, so they start from this artifact and run
  alongside the stock build.
- **`vendor-sdk`** (`needs: vendor-sdk-source`) -- builds the SDK's stock
  image (`make vendor-sdk-stock`). Isolated because it's the single most
  expensive, most fragile stage (~14 GiB, ~95 minutes). Its output
  (`build/vendor`) is uploaded as the `vendor-sdk` artifact, which only
  `build-image` consumes.
- **`build-native-libkvm`** -- independent of the vendor SDK. Builds
  the SDK middleware, `libkvm.so`, `libkvm_mmf.so` and `kvm_system` with one
  toolchain: the one MaixCDK pins (Xuantie GCC 10.2, musl), fetched by
  `scripts/fetch-maixcdk-toolchain.sh`. Uploads `native-libkvm-build`.
- **`build-kernel`** (`needs: vendor-sdk-source`) -- rehydrates the 5.10.265
  kernel source and builds it. Uploads `kernel-build` (source plus build
  tree, for the module builds) and `kernel-boot` (the `Image`, the DTB and
  `utsrelease.h`, for the boot FIT).
- **`build-modules`** (`needs: vendor-sdk-source, build-kernel`) -- builds the 30
  external and 3 media kernel modules against that tree, substitutes them
  and the 24 in-tree modules into the `/mnt/system/ko` skeleton, and writes
  the provenance records, then checks all 57 against the kernel's vermagic and
  `System.map` with `depmod -e`. Uploads `kernel-modules`. The kernel tree must be
  unpacked at the same absolute path it was built at, which holds because
  every job uses the same workspace directory.
- **`build-image`** (`needs: vendor-sdk, build-native-libkvm, build-kernel,
  build-modules`) -- Buildroot bootstrap, the `kvmapp` Rust bridge, the
  remaining runtime files, rootfs assembly, boot FIT image, and the final
  recovery-SD image.

All jobs run in a `sg2002-image-build` concurrency group
(`cancel-in-progress: false`): dispatches queue rather than race, and a
new dispatch only ever cancels a run still waiting in that queue, never one
already executing.

## raw.12 dependency status

Everything below refers to the *published* `hardened-nanokvm-system-0.3.0-raw.12.tar.gz`
system archive specifically -- not the separate `kvmapp` app-package
archive, which retains one deliberate exception (see "Explicitly out of
scope" below). **The pipeline no longer fetches this archive at all.**

### Closed

| Content | How it's sourced now | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All 57 kernel modules (24 in-tree, 30 external, 3 media) | Rebuilt from source: in-tree modules from this pipeline's own kernel build; 30 external CVITEK/WiFi/BT/touch modules from the vendor SDK's `osdrv` tree; 3 media modules from a 3-stage chain across the vendor SDK and public `sophgo/osdrv` at two pinned commits | `support/sg2002/kernel/5.10.265/manifests/external-modules.txt`; workflow steps "Rebuild external CVITEK kernel modules from source" through "Substitute freshly-built modules into the runtime staging dir" |
| `libkvm.so` / `libkvm_mmf.so` | Built from source by the `build-native-libkvm` job: `support/sg2002` compiled with a pinned MaixCDK and its musl toolchain (the LT6911 chip-ID probe removed). The video-path components (`kvm`, `kvm_mmf`, `vision`) build at `-O2`; the rest keeps MaixCDK's `MinSizeRel` (`-Os`). `libkvm_mmf.so` starts LT6911 capture without the ISP and links no ISP/3A library. The Rust backend links against the result. Never depended on raw.12 either way | job `build-native-libkvm`; `server-rust/scripts/build-linked-libkvm.sh` |
| 4 OpenCV modules (`core`/`highgui`/`imgcodecs`/`imgproc`) | Sourced from `sipeed/NanoKVM` upstream (GPL-3.0), verified near-byte-identical (same MaixCDK toolchain build) | workflow step "Source OpenCV core/highgui/imgcodecs/imgproc from upstream"; `server-rust/native/README.md` |
| 6 OpenCV/protobuf modules (`video`/`dnn`/`calib3d`/`features2d`/`flann`/`protobuf`) | Deleted entirely -- proven via exhaustive symbol-table analysis that `libkvm.so` calls nothing from them, after a `patchelf --remove-needed` patch | `server-rust/native/README.md` ("libkvm.so: removed video NEEDED entry") |
| `/mnt/system/usr/bin` (49 CVITEK sample/test binaries) | Deleted entirely -- no static or `dlopen()` reference anywhere in tracked source | `server-rust/native/README.md` ("/mnt/system/usr") |
| `/mnt/system/usr/lib` minus one file (32 files incl. `3rd/`) | Deleted entirely -- proven redundant against `dl_lib`'s search-path priority | same |
| `libsys.so`, `libvenc.so`, `libvdec.so`, `libvpu.so`, `libini.so` | Built from source in `build-native-libkvm`: `middleware/v2` of the pinned vendor SDK, with the SDK's flags but `-O2` instead of `-Os`, by `scripts/build-sdk-middleware.sh`. Each must keep every export of the checked-in prebuilt it replaces. `libkvm_mmf.so` links against them and the image ships them | workflow steps "Fetch the SDK middleware source" and "Build the Sophgo middleware from source" |
| ~19 other CVI/audio middleware libraries in `dl_lib` (`libcvi_*`, `libaac*`, `libcli.so`, etc.). The 8 closed ISP/3A libraries (`libisp*`, `libae`/`af`/`awb`, `libcvi_bin*`, `libcvi_ispd2`) are removed | Already checked into `server-rust/native/dl_lib` since before this fork tracked raw.12 at all; diffed byte-for-byte against raw.12 and confirmed identical; the CI pipeline no longer extracts them from raw.12 | `server-rust/native/README.md` ("dl_lib's CVI/ISP/audio middleware") |
| `libc.so` + 4 GCC runtime libs (`libstdc++.so.6.0.28`, `libgcc_s.so.1`, `libgomp.so.1.0.0`, `libatomic.so.1.2.0`) | Sourced from this pipeline's own `vendor-sdk-stock` build instead -- verified byte-identical on a real run | workflow step "Source the remaining runtime files from our own vendor-sdk-stock build"; `server-rust/native/README.md` |
| 2 T-Head musl loaders (`ld-musl-riscv64xthead.so.1`, `ld-musl-riscv64v0p7_xthead.so.1`) | Same as above -- byte-identical to `vendor-sdk-stock`'s own copies | same |
| `libsns_lt6911.so` (LT6911 HDMI sensor plugin) | Sourced from `vendor-sdk-stock` too, from real checked-in C source in the pinned vendor SDK commit (`middleware/v2/component/isp/sensor/cv182x/lontium_lt6911/`, `sg200x` symlinked to `cv182x`). No longer byte-identical to an unmodified vendor build, deliberately: `vendor-sdk-patches/lt6911-sensor-id-probe-removed.patch` removes the chip-ID probe, which never succeeds on this board while HDMI capture works without it. The other files `vendor-sdk-stock` produces are untouched, except `fip.bin` (next row) | `server-rust/native/README.md` ("libc.so, GCC runtime, loaders, and libsns_lt6911.so"); `buildroot-external/hardened-sg2002/board/sg2002/vendor-sdk-patches/lt6911-sensor-id-probe-removed.patch` |
| `fip.bin` (FSBL, OpenSBI, U-Boot) | Built by `vendor-sdk-stock` with `vendor-sdk-patches/fsbl-overdrive-clocks.patch`, which sets `CONFIG_OD_CLK_SEL=y` in the board defconfig: the FSBL's overdrive table runs the C906 at 1050 MHz instead of 850 MHz, the video encoder at 515 MHz instead of 396 MHz, and raises VDDC from 0.96 V to 1.00 V. System updates ship this `fip.bin` too | `fsbl/plat/cv181x/platform.c` (`sys_pll_od`) in the pinned vendor SDK; `buildroot-external/hardened-sg2002/board/sg2002/vendor-sdk-patches/fsbl-overdrive-clocks.patch` |

**No file shipped in the final image still comes from raw.12.** The
kernel/rootfs closure work, the `dl_lib` middleware closure, and this last
round together account for every file the pipeline ever pulled from it.

### `kvm_system`: built from source too

`kvm_system` used to be the one exception: it was taken from the published
`kvmapp` app-package archive (`hardened-nanokvm-kvmapp-2.0.42.tar.gz`), because
the maintainer's build carried the 26 native-audit fixes and rebuilding it
needed MaixCDK, which the pipeline did not have. Once the `build-native-libkvm`
job brought MaixCDK in for `libkvm`, the same job could run `./build kvm_system`.
It now does, strips the build-host RPATH, and checks that the binary uses the
T-Head musl loader and needs only `libstdc++`, `libgcc_s` and `libc`.

Before switching, a one-off workflow built `kvm_system` from the RC10 source
(`26a2986`) with the same pins: every code and data section matched the
published 2.0.42 binary byte for byte; only an `$ORIGIN/dl_lib` RPATH differed,
which the job strips. The current source differs from RC10 only by sipeed's
shared VI-state reader, so the image now ships both halves of that port. With
this, the pipeline downloads no published Hardened artifact at all.

### The module-tree structure: closed too, no image needed at all

The kernel module *paths* (8 of 57 nest under `3rd/`) used to come from
raw.12's own `system/ko/` tree, purely so the pipeline knew where each
freshly-rebuilt `.ko` belonged -- module content itself was never sourced
from raw.12 once the kernel-module rebuild work closed that gap. This
turned out not to need any image at all:
`support/sg2002/kernel/5.10.265/manifests/external-modules.txt` already
encodes the full destination path for all 30 external modules (`3rd/`
included), `in-tree-modules.txt` gives the other 24, and the 3 media
module names are already known constants -- the complete structure,
entirely from files already tracked in this repo. `system-image.yml`
now builds this as an empty-file skeleton straight from the manifests, no
network fetch involved; `hardened-source-media-provenance.txt` is
regenerated from already-pinned values the same way.

**raw.12 is no longer fetched anywhere in this pipeline.** One
diagnostic, not a structural or content dependency worth keeping, was
removed while closing this: `build-historical-sophgo-vc-driver.sh` used
to diff `soph_vc_driver.ko`'s module parameters against an "old"
reference copy pulled from raw.12 -- a real comparison, since `modinfo`
needs an actual valid module, not something a placeholder could satisfy.
That comparison is gone rather than kept as a narrower exception.

## Verification methodology

Every claim above is backed by one of:

- **Byte-for-byte comparison** (`cmp`/`sha256sum`) between a candidate
  source and raw.12's shipped copy, not just matching filenames/sizes.
- **Exhaustive symbol-table analysis** (`readelf --dyn-syms`) for the
  `libkvm.so` OpenCV dependency removal, checking every undefined symbol
  against every candidate export set.
- **`dlopen()` reference search** across every native binary and every
  tracked script, for content removed on the basis of "nothing references
  it."
- **SHA-256 pinning** throughout the workflow and in
  `scripts/validate-latest-buildroot-sg2002-rootfs.sh`, which re-checks
  final image content against pinned hashes regardless of which step
  produced it.

Dead ends are documented, not silently dropped: the public
`sophgo/host-tools` cross-toolchain repo was tried for both the loaders and
`libc.so` before `vendor-sdk-stock` was tried -- it's a generic
cross-toolchain build (unstripped, wrong size), not the vendor's on-device
runtime build, and that negative result is recorded in
`server-rust/native/README.md` alongside the positive ones so it isn't
re-attempted.

## External dependency audit

Closing raw.12 could have quietly traded one external dependency for
another unnecessary one. Auditing every non-raw.12 external fetch this
pipeline makes, against whether the already-cloned vendor SDK could have
supplied the same content instead:

| External source | What it provides | Redundant with the vendor SDK? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sophgo/host-tools` | The actual riscv64 cross-compiler toolchain, used to build the kernel and every kernel module | No -- this is the compiler itself; a prebuilt rootfs can't substitute for a toolchain. Confirmed by grepping every script that references it: all of them use `TOOLCHAIN_BIN=.../host-tools/gcc/riscv64-linux-musl-x86_64/bin` to invoke `gcc`/`ld`/`strip` directly. |
| `sipeed/NanoKVM` upstream | 4 OpenCV modules (`core`/`highgui`/`imgcodecs`/`imgproc`) | No -- confirmed by reading `scripts/prepare-latest-buildroot-sg2002-vendor-runtime.sh`, the historical script that originally extracted content from `vendor-sdk-stock`'s own rootfs: its own OpenCV set is `video`/`dnn`/`calib3d`/`features2d`/`flann`/`protobuf` at `/usr/lib/` -- exactly the 6 modules already proven unused and deleted, not the 4 this pipeline needs. `vendor-sdk-stock` never had the right OpenCV variant. |
| `sophgo/osdrv` (public, 2 pinned commits) | `soph_jpeg.ko` and `soph_vc_driver.ko` media modules | No -- already established when the kernel-module rebuild work closed this gap: the vendor SDK's own bundled `osdrv` predates compat fixes these two modules need. |
| `git.kernel.org` stable tree | Real upstream Linux 5.10.265 fixes for the kernel rehydration | Not applicable -- the whole point is pulling genuine upstream fixes the vendor's own kernel snapshot doesn't have. |
| `buildroot.org` | The Buildroot release tarball itself | Not applicable -- an unrelated upstream project, not vendor SDK content. |

One narrower finding, since fixed: `build-linked-libkvm.sh` used to link
`libkvm.so` against `sophgo/host-tools`' own `libc.so`/`libgcc_s.so.1`
sysroot copies -- the same files independently confirmed elsewhere in this
pipeline to *not* be the on-device runtime build. It worked in practice
(linking only needs matching symbol tables, not byte-identical content),
but meant linking and runtime used two different sources for the same
files. `vendor-sdk-stock`'s rootfs.sd is available from the start of the
`build-image` job (the same cache restored early on), so no reordering was
actually needed -- `scripts/extract-vendor-sdk-stock-file.sh` now extracts
the sysroot copies the same way the runtime files are extracted later,
and both steps share that one script instead of duplicating the
probe-multiple-candidate-paths logic.
