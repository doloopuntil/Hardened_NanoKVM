# Web UI

The React frontend lives in `web/` (Vite, TypeScript, antd, Tailwind, jotai).

## Layout

```text
web/src
├── api        calls to the backend
├── components shared pieces: setting rows, save bar, page header, dialog parts, menu rows
├── hooks
├── i18n       locales/*.ts (one complete file per language), translations.test.ts
├── jotai      global state
├── lib        helpers; feedback.ts holds the confirm/toast helpers
├── pages      auth (login, setup, TOTP), desktop (menu bar, settings, PicoClaw), terminal
└── router.tsx
```

## Commands

Run them from the repository root, as CI does:

```sh
corepack pnpm --dir web install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm --dir web build      # tsc + vite build into web/dist
corepack pnpm --dir web test       # vitest: translations, PicoClaw protocol, tool-call summaries
corepack pnpm --dir web lint
corepack pnpm --dir web format     # prettier
```

If ESLint crashes with `expand is not a function`, the local `node_modules` is
out of step with the lockfile; reinstall with `--frozen-lockfile` (in a scratch
copy if you want to keep yours).

## Develop against a device

1. Point `VITE_SERVER_IP` in `web/.env.development` at the device.
2. Sign-in does not work across origins, so turn authentication off on a test
   device only. Over SSH (user `root`, the web account's password), add both
   lines to `/etc/kvm/server.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   authentication: disable
   security:
     allow_auth_disable: true
   ```

   and run `/etc/init.d/S95nanokvm restart`. Never leave this on a device you
   use.
3. `corepack pnpm --dir web dev` and open <http://localhost:3001/>. Turn off the
   browser cache in the developer tools while you work.

To work on sign-in or TOTP, build and run the UI on the device instead.

## Deploy a build by hand

Copy `web/dist` to the device as `/kvmapp/server/web` and run
`/etc/init.d/S95nanokvm restart`. An application update does the same with
signature checks ([Build and deploy the server](cross-build.md)).

## Rules

- Settings pages, menu bar popovers, dialogs and toasts follow
  [Web UI layout rules](web-ui-layout-rules.md). Use the shared components and
  `lib/feedback.ts` rather than new one-off markup.
- Copy rules are in the **Text** section of those rules: sentence case, one
  sentence without a final full stop for captions and toasts, menu paths as
  "Settings > Device > Virtual disk".
- Every new or changed English string goes into `en.ts` and all other language
  files in `web/src/i18n/locales/`, keys in the order of `en.ts`.
  `translations.test.ts` fails on missing or extra keys, broken placeholders and
  copy-rule violations.
- Tailwind's preflight is off: give borders `border-solid`, and add `box-border`
  to elements with both a width and padding.
