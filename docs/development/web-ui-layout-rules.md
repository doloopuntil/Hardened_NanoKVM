# Web UI layout rules for the Settings pages

These rules grew page by page while the Settings pages were unified. They
describe what the pages do now; the shared pieces live in
`web/src/components/setting-rows.tsx` and `web/src/components/save-bar.tsx`,
and the dialog and toast helpers in `web/src/lib/feedback.ts`.

## Page structure

1. A page starts with `PageHeader` (`components/page-header.tsx`): its title in
   `text-base` and a hairline under it, which stay in view while the page
   scrolls, also on a page too short to scroll. The title and the hairline sit at
   the same height on every page. The touch layout shows no header: the
   navigation above the page names it. What sits
   beside the title is the header's children. Pages that belong together, such
   as System and Networking, are subpages in the left pane of the dialog, not tabs in
   the header. The header is in the colour of the panel, and its shadow has a
   negative spread so it fades out before its sides: the scroll area clips what
   goes beyond the width of the content, and a wider shadow ends in a hard edge.
   The loading and load-failure banner of the page comes right below the header
   (`LoadBanner`), where the header's cover does not hide it.
2. A page is a column of titled sections with the same faded hairline between
   them. A section is `SettingSection`: a grey sentence-case title
   (`text-neutral-400`), then its rows 24px apart.
3. No frames, cards or bordered boxes, and no result panels with icons. The
   exceptions are the viewers of text that comes from the system (the System
   log and the Current rules of the firewall, a dark box with monospace text)
   and the firewall mode tiles.
4. Read-only lines (`InfoRow`) are grouped in a `space-y-3` column. A row is at
   least 32px tall, so a line keeps its height whether it is read-only or
   editable.
5. Names are shared between pages when they mean the same thing: Connection
   (Network, WireGuard, Tailscale), Encrypted tunnel, Latest version, Login.
   A section title never repeats the label of its first row.

## Rows and fields

6. Use only the shared rows: `SettingRow` (label and caption left, control
   right; `isSwitch` and `inline` keep a narrow control on the label's row on a
   phone), `InfoRow` (value grey and right-aligned; it may carry a caption),
   `EditableInfoRow` (the same row with an input) and `SettingSection`.
7. Values are right-aligned, including the text inside inputs and tag fields.
   Every field has a caption except the editable address fields of Network
   (IP address, subnet mask, router, prefix), whose meaning is well understood.
8. Inputs are sized to their content with standard Tailwind widths (`w-20`,
   `w-24`, `sm:w-36`, `sm:w-72`). The one accepted exception is the WireGuard
   public key. A unit is a fixed label beside the box (`Space.Compact` with
   `Space.Addon`), never part of the value.
9. A field that depends on a switch stays visible and is disabled while the
   switch is off. Nothing appears or disappears with a switch.
10. A value that comes from the system (IPv4 and IPv6 outside manual mode) is
    shown read-only in the same row where the editable field would be.
11. On a phone, switches, info rows, buttons and the fields (inputs, selects
    and tag boxes) stay on the label's row; the field is narrower than on the
    desktop (`w-20` to `w-44`) and the caption wraps beside it. The one field
    that goes under its title is the WireGuard peer public key, which is wide on
    purpose so the whole key shows. An error message wraps to the width of its
    field and never widens it.
12. Long values wrap at spaces and hyphens (`break-words`); `break-all` is only
    for a single token with no spaces, such as a key or a URL.

## Buttons and actions

13. Buttons sit on the right. A group that wraps stays right-aligned
    (`ml-auto` on the group).
14. An action that runs something is a row with a caption and a button
    (Restart, Stop). Destructive, irreversible or disruptive actions (Logout,
    Reboot, Uninstall) go in a bar at the end of the page, under a hairline, as
    red outline buttons (`danger`, not `type="primary"`).
15. A primary (blue) button is the one main positive action of a page or state.
    An action that needs a confirmation uses one of two forms, by what it costs:
    - `Popconfirm`, with a one-line question and Yes / No, for a quick action
      that is easy to undo (Restart Tailscale, Stop Tailscale, Account logout).
    - `confirm()` from `lib/feedback.ts`, a dialog, for anything destructive,
      irreversible or consequential (deleting, rebooting the KVM, leaving
      Tailscale, uninstalling, applying a change that reboots the device or
      drops the connection in use), and for any confirmation that needs more
      than one line (an explanation, a file name, an alert).
    A dialog names the action in its title and its OK button (Reboot, Delete,
    Uninstall; the common Confirm only when no single word fits), asks the
    question as its content, and has the common Cancel. `danger: true` is only
    for destructive or irreversible actions, so the OK button is red; a
    consequential action that can be undone stays plain. No confirmation is a
    hand-built `Modal`. Exception: the confirmations of the Power menu are
    Popconfirms with a red OK button, because a dialog is too heavy for a menu
    item and they act on the host.
16. Unsaved changes show in the sticky `SaveBar` at the bottom, never in the
    page header. The bar is as wide as the content, in the panel colour
    (`bg-settings-panel`) like the page header, with a hairline above it and a
    shadow that pushes up from there, with the same negative spread as the
    header's.

## Status and feedback

17. A state message is the caption of the field it describes: up to date or
    update available under the version row, "downloaded and verified" under
    Staged version, "reboot required" under Pending version.
18. A busy state is a small spinner with text; while the information of a
    section loads, the spinner sits after its title (`busy` of `SettingSection`).
    An error is red
    (`text-red-400`). A headline above the buttons is only for a state that is
    a message in itself ("Boot confirmed").
19. An `Alert` is for a state that blocks something (Paranoid mode, raw
    installs disabled, the clock not synchronized) and goes above the
    sections.
20. Secondary explanation goes in a tooltip behind a help icon; a warning
    tooltip uses an orange alert icon, always through `LabelTip`
    (`components/label-tip.tsx`, tooltip above the icon). A caption says what a
    setting does; a tooltip says what it costs or how it is sized.
21. A control stays disabled until its own load has succeeded
    (`useSettingsLoad`), and every failed action is visible (`attempt()` and
    `toast`).

## Text

22. Sentence case everywhere: labels, buttons, section titles and tab names.
    Only real names keep capitals: Tailscale, WireGuard, the firewall modes
    (Baseline, Moderate, Restricted, Paranoid), the key names Num Lock, Caps
    Lock and Scroll Lock, and "HID-Only mode". Protocol and file names (HDMI, SSH,
    mDNS, HTTPS, Changelog) stay as they are in every language.
23. Every text starts with a capital letter, with no parentheses and no "!".
    Captions, tooltips, toasts and field errors are one sentence without a
    final full stop. Dialogs, banners and step lists stay multi-sentence with
    full stops.
24. Menu paths read "Settings > Device > Virtual disk".
25. Every new or changed English string needs all 25 languages. Every language
    is one file in `web/src/i18n/locales/`, with the keys in the order of
    `en.ts`; there are no overlay layers. Compare the effective strings of
    every language before and after a change to prove that nothing else moved;
    `translations.test.ts` checks that no language misses a key or has an
    extra one, and that the copy rules hold.

## Order

26. Tabs: About, Account, Appearance, Device, System, WireGuard, Tailscale,
    System updates. The System sub-pages are Time, Network, Firewall, Logging,
    and System opens on Time.

## Technical rules

27. Tailwind's preflight is off (it clashes with antd), so a border needs an
    explicit style (`border-0 border-b border-solid border-white/[0.06]`);
    `border-b` alone draws nothing. Boxes also keep the browser's default
    sizing, where padding and border add to the width and height: an element
    with a width and padding (`w-full px-4`) needs `box-border`, or it is wider
    than its parent. Do not switch box-sizing on globally: the menu bar popovers
    were sized for the default, and their rows would shrink by 8px.
28. A sticky element must not sit inside an `overflow-x-hidden` container; that
    makes the container its scroll parent and the element stops sticking.
29. Layout depends on the phone class `settings-modal-mobile` (see
    `assets/styles/index.css`); use
    `[.settings-modal-mobile_&]:` for rules that differ on the touch layout.
30. The app is dark-only. The colour of the settings panel is the one
    `settings-panel` colour of `tailwind.config.js` (the modal colour under a 50%
    layer, as a solid colour), used by the panel itself and by whatever sticks over
    its content, so that it hides what scrolls under it. Do not write the value
    again.

## Menu bar popovers

The popovers of the menu bar (`web/src/pages/desktop/menu/`) are a different
surface from the Settings pages and are built from `components/menu-rows.tsx`:

- Every popover starts with `MenuHeader`: the title of the entry and a hairline.
  What sits on the right of the title (the Upload button of Scripts, the
  Confirmation switch of Power) is its children.
- A row that does something or opens something is a `MenuRow`: an 18px icon and
  a label, 30px tall. A row that opens a list of options is a `MenuSubmenu`, which
  has the same box. An entry that is switched on shows in blue (`active`).
- A list of options is `MenuOption` rows: a blue check in front of the chosen
  one, nothing else marks the choice. An option may carry a small icon.
- Rows pass their props on, so a row can sit inside a `Popconfirm` or a `Tooltip`.
- No popover writes its own row classes, header or divider margin.

The dialogs that the entries open follow the same idea (`components/dialog-parts.tsx`):

- The title is the dialog's own `title`, never a hand-made heading. What the dialog
  is about goes under it as a `DialogHint`, in small grey text.
- The width is antd's default. There are two exceptions: the output of a script is
  600px wide because it shows log text, and the Serial Port form is 420px because
  it is a short column of labels and small controls.
- A dialog has one main button, a `DialogAction`: `min-w-24`, centred under the
  content, and named after what it does (Paste, Save, Open terminal), not Submit
  or Ok. A close button is the same button.
- Dialogs are centred. The one exception is a dialog with a text box, which is
  not centred on a phone, so that the phone's keyboard does not cover the box.
- A form in a dialog uses the `SettingRow` rows of the Settings pages.
- A confirmation names its action in the title (rule 15), never "Attention".

The PicoClaw sidebar is part of the menu bar and follows the same rules where it can:

- Its header buttons are the 30px squares of the menu bar with a tooltip. Stopping the
  assistant asks first (a Popconfirm, rule 15), because it ends a task that is running.
- The gear (Settings) menu is a popover of `MenuRow`s like the menu bar's, not an antd
  dropdown; a row that destroys something (Uninstall) is `danger`.
- A screen that does not show the chat (install, model) reports a failure with a toast, since
  the chat transcript is not visible there.
- Its accent is the blue of the rest of the app (`blue-400` / `blue-500`, `blue-600` for the
  user's bubbles), not sky-blue.
- A screen with nothing to show yet (start, install, no history, no messages) is an
  `EmptyState`: a centred icon tile, a title, a caption and one action.
- What the agent does while it works shows in the chat as Action boxes (one per tool call of
  PicoClaw: taking a screenshot, typing, pressing keys), and "Processing..." stays on for the
  whole run. PicoClaw does not say when a run is over: a text message ends it unless a tool call
  follows within 1.5 s (see `lib/picoclaw-gateway.ts`).
- The result of an action (started, stopped, saved, installed) is a toast; the chat shows only
  what happens in the session (connecting, connected, closed).
- The model form is the one place that is not `SettingRow`s: the input sits under its label,
  because the sidebar is too narrow to hold a model name or an URL beside it.

## Adding or changing a page

- Start from the title and hairline, then `SettingSection`s; reach for a
  shared row before writing flex markup.
- Give every field a caption, or leave it bare on purpose and say so here.
- Put the strings in all languages, sentence case, one sentence without a full
  stop for captions.
- Check the page at desktop width and at 375px: title and hairline position,
  rows wrapping, buttons wrapping to the right, long values.

## Open deviations

None at the moment. The audit of 2026-10-17 found fifteen; they were fixed or
turned into the exceptions named in the rules above. List here what a page
still does against the rules, and remove the entry when it is fixed or turned
into an exception.
