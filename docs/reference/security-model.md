# Security model

What the Hardened server protects, how, and what is still open. User-facing
behaviour is in the guides ([sign-in](../guide/sign-in.md),
[firewall](../guide/firewall.md), [updates](../guide/updates.md)).

## Threat model in brief

- The web UI and API are the main attack surface. Everything except sign-in,
  first-account setup, the static UI and a version endpoint needs a session.
- A signed-in user is the device's administrator: the account is also `root`
  over SSH, and the terminal and scripts run as root. The controls below keep
  out people who are not signed in, and limit what a stolen session can do
  without the password.
- The host machine is not trusted either: what it shows on screen reaches the
  PicoClaw agent, and what the agent returns is rendered in the browser.
- Updates must be signed; the device trusts only its bundled update key.

## Controls

| Area | Control |
| --- | --- |
| First boot | No default credential. Without `/etc/kvm/pwd`, the UI asks for the first account. `security.allow_default_admin` stays off. |
| Passwords | Argon2id for new passwords, bcrypt still accepted. Changing the password needs the current one and also sets the `root` password. |
| Sessions | Opaque in-memory sessions, per-device secret, revoked on logout and password change. Optional idle lock. |
| Two-factor | Optional TOTP with backup codes; every change needs the password; `security.require_totp` confines an unenrolled session to enrolment. |
| CSRF and origin | CSRF token plus `Origin`/`Referer` check on every state-changing request; WebSockets check `Origin`. |
| Brute force | Lockout after 5 failures per address and user, for 10 minutes. TOTP failures count too. |
| Browser | Security headers on every response; the CSP allows scripts and images only from the device (images also from `data:`), so chat output cannot load external content. |
| Commands | Privileged commands go through an argv-only allowlist (`system/command.rs`) with timeouts and bounded output; no shell strings. |
| Files and archives | Atomic `0600` writes for secrets, symlink and traversal checks, bounded archive extraction. |
| Updates | Signed metadata and payload hashes for application and system updates; raw partition writes need an explicit switch; boot watchdog rollback. |
| Virtual media | Images served read-only to the host; `/data` has one writer at a time; image paths confined to `/data`; remote download off by default and limited to `http`/`https` ISO files. |
| Network | Managed firewall, Moderate (local sources only) by default; WebRTC blocked in Restricted and Paranoid; WireGuard peers admitted only on `wg0` from their allowed ranges. |
| Audit | Sign-ins, two-factor changes and WireGuard changes are logged to syslog with the source address. |
| PicoClaw | Gateway on `127.0.0.1` with a token; internal routes accept only loopback requests with the internal token; installer pinned to a SHA-256; a stored model key is reused only for the same API origin. |

## Open items

- The server runs as root. Splitting privileged operations into a smaller
  helper is future work.
- Password checks on password change and two-factor changes are not rate
  limited, so a stolen session could use them to guess the password.
- The login lockout is per address and user, with no global counter.
- Remote ISO download has no allowlist of sources; it stays off by default.
- Retained vendor components with `NOASSERTION` licence metadata remain a
  documented limitation.

## Root-Required Operations

These operations must remain behind narrow wrappers or a future privileged
helper:

- HID device writes: `/dev/hidg0`, `/dev/hidg1`, `/dev/hidg2`.
- USB mass-storage gadget sysfs writes under `/sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/...`.
  Normal virtual-media changes should be limited to removable-LUN eject/insert
  and flag updates. USB gadget reconnect is allowed when switching the media
  type between CD-ROM and mass storage because many BIOS/boot menus cache the
  previous LUN type; otherwise it remains an explicit compatibility fallback.
- USB HID configfs topology changes must not be performed live from the web
  backend. A live UDC detach plus HID unlink/relink test on a device caused a
  kernel oops; only direct attribute writes or reboot-time config changes are
  acceptable.
- GPIO/ATX writes under hardware-specific device paths.
- Network writes under `/etc/kvm`, DNS hooks, Wi-Fi files, and service restarts.
- Application update promotion under `/kvmapp`.
- System update promotion for boot/rootfs files and raw partition payloads.
- Reboot and init-script service control.
- Terminal PTY shell, when explicitly enabled.

## Command Execution Inventory

Rust API modules should not spawn shell command strings directly. Normal
service control and utility execution goes through
`system::command::run_allowed`, which provides an allowlisted argv-only wrapper
with timeouts and bounded output.

Main command call sites:

- `server-rust/src/api/application.rs`: app metadata/download and service restart.
- `server-rust/src/api/system_update.rs`: signed system-update metadata,
  staging, and guarded loader execution.
- `server-rust/src/api/download.rs`: guarded remote ISO downloader.
- `server-rust/src/api/network.rs`: WOL, Wi-Fi service control, Ethernet
  restart, and IPv6 route inspection.
- `server-rust/src/api/system_firewall.rs`, `system_log.rs`, `system_time.rs`,
  `tailscale.rs`, `vm.rs`, `hid.rs`, and `account.rs`: allowlisted service or
  system utility calls.

Known exceptions:

- `server-rust/src/api/script.rs` runs user-managed scripts from the configured
  script inventory and remains a root-required administrative feature.
- `server-rust/src/ws/hid.rs` invokes the fixed USB gadget init script for HID
  recovery.
- `server-rust/src/api/system_update.rs` runs a staged, generated loader from
  the signed system-update cache after path validation.
- Native SG2002 C/C++ support code contains fixed `system(...)` calls for
  hardware initialization and factory-compatible control paths. The 2026-07-11
  audit of that code and its remediation are in
  [`native-code-audit.md`](../archive/native-code-audit.md).

## File And Archive Risk Inventory

- Account file: `/etc/kvm/pwd`, mode `0600`.
- Session secret: `/etc/kvm/session_secret`, generated and written `0600`.
- Update cache: `/data/.hardened-kvmcache`; application updates use
  `application-update`, system updates use `system-update`.
- System-update archives are constrained to declared payload roots and reject
  runtime/cache roots such as `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, `/tmp`, `/data`,
  `/kvmapp`, and `/root/.kvmcache`.
- Image directory: `/data`, with resolved containment and symlink rejection.
- Script directory: `/etc/kvm/scripts`, with basename inventory and explicit
  execution only.
- Autostart directory: `/etc/kvm/autostart`, with traversal rejection.
- DNS/Wi-Fi files: strict value validation and atomic writes.
- WireGuard: `/etc/kvm/wireguard/kvm.conf` holds only validated values, one
  `Key=value` per line, because `S40firewall` and `S45wireguard` read it with
  `sed`; `private.key` is written `0600` and never returned by the API.
- PicoClaw: sessions are read only from PicoClaw's own sessions directory, file
  names derived from session keys have path separators replaced, and symlinked
  entries are skipped.
