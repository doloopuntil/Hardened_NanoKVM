# HTTPS certificate

With HTTPS on, the device serves a self-signed certificate, so the browser warns on
every first visit. **Settings > Network > Services > Secure web access** can use a
trusted certificate instead. The choice is under **Certificate**:

| Source | Needs | Good for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Self-signed | Nothing. | Local use, with the browser warning. |
| Tailscale | Tailscale running and signed in, and HTTPS certificates enabled for the tailnet in the Tailscale admin console. | Reaching the KVM by its `*.ts.net` name. No setup on the device. |
| Let's Encrypt | A domain whose DNS points at the device, and port 443 reachable from the internet. | A domain of your own. |

## Change the source

1. Turn HTTPS on first. The certificate rows stay disabled while it is off.
2. Pick the source. For Let's Encrypt, enter the domain; the email is optional.
3. Press **Save changes** and enter your password, and a two-factor code if your
   account has one. This is a sensitive change, so it asks for both.
4. The device requests the certificate, which takes up to a minute. If it fails,
   the current certificate stays and the reason shows under **Last renewal**.
5. When it works, a dialog gives the new address. Open it and sign in there. The new
   certificate belongs to that address, so the browser signs in again. Press **Keep**
   within 3 minutes, or the previous certificate comes back without a restart.

## Let's Encrypt behind a router

Let's Encrypt connects to port 443 on your public address from the internet.
Forward external port 443 to the device's HTTPS port, and point the domain's A record
(and AAAA, if you use IPv6) at your public address. Behind carrier-grade NAT, with no
public address, use Tailscale instead.

The firewall modes (Moderate, Restricted, Paranoid) accept connections only from the
local network. While an order runs, the device opens its HTTPS port to the internet
and closes it again when the order ends. Paranoid blocks the outgoing connections the
request needs, so no certificate is requested in that mode. See
[Firewall modes](firewall.md).

## Renewal

The device checks every hour and renews in the last 30 days. After a failure it waits
an hour, then six hours, then a day, and shows the last error. The clock must be
synchronized and HTTPS on. If a certificate expires and cannot be renewed, the device
serves its self-signed certificate again, so the interface stays reachable. **Renew
now** requests a certificate without waiting.

## Testing

The file `/etc/kvm/certs/settings.json` has a `staging` flag that uses Let's Encrypt's
staging service, whose certificates no browser trusts and whose limits are generous.
Use it to test the setup before requesting a real certificate, which is limited to a
few per week for a domain.
